What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

In git a Repository is initialized by running the following command in the directory to be the Repository:

$git init

It will initialize and create all the necessary artificats for git, so that you can start creating commits and add files to the version control


-----------------------------------

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an interim stage where files can me added to build a logical unit of work before committing the changes to the repository as a commit.
